HOW TO SETUP AND RUN

Django requires python (preferably python3 but python2 should work) and pip to install. Django can be installed with the following command:

pip install Django==1.10.1


Next the servers dependencies need to be install. This can be done using the following commands:

pip install django-bootstrap3
pip install django-notifications-hq


Now with the dependences installed the django server can be started from the CommunityOrganization folder by running the following command

python manage.py runserver


Django should start a server at localhost on port 8000

http://127.0.0.1:8000/
or
http://localhost:8000/
